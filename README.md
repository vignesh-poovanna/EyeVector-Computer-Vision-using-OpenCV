# EyeVector-Computer-Vision-using-OpenCV
EyeVector is a real-time eye tracking system that detects blinks and gaze direction using OpenCV and dlib. It allows hands-free mute/unmute of system audio via double blink, displays session statistics, and alerts on prolonged eye closure. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for accessibility and attention monitoring applications.
